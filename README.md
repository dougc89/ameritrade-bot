## What this is.
This is a casual project by a casual investor, looking to solve the following problems:
* I believe I could make more $$ in the market with constant attention to my portfolio, but do not have the time available in real life to do this.
* With more frequent trading, accruing value from smaller flucuations would be possible. Waiting for larger price changes to trigger trades on manually set limits means missing out on some value that could be extracted from flucuations that did not meet that larger threshold.
* Trading by emotions is a known path to failure in the market. Trading by cold logic will always be better than, as an example, trading by FOMO. Code follows logic with no emotion.

## What this is not.
This project is not the work of a professional stock trader. Any actual trades made based on the logic therein come with the risks of stock market investing; namely the loss of investment funds. If you are willing to take the risks, and the possible rewards, then enjoy the game!
